# VotingApp

INFO498A iOS dev final project.

Yay.

## How to Work on This

You __cannot__ open the `VotingApp.xcodeproject` file!!!

Please open `PodWorkspace.xcworkspace` instead. This makes it so that
all project dependencies for the project are included. The project should
compile, and Parse and Font awesome should both be included. This is just because of the way Cocoapods work.
